# Timmy build guide
[work in progress]

Here you'll find a step by step guide to build Timmy. Actually, it's very short:
1. Get all of the components
2. Print the chassi
3. Solder electronics together (there will be a more detailed guide on this soon!)
4. Program the transmitter

## Required components
* 2x [Turnigy 15mm 75:1 motor]({{ site.url }}/parts#turnigy-motor-15mm-75-1){:target="_blank"}
* 2x [Brushed ESC]({{ site.url }}/parts#generic-brushed-esc){:target="_blank"}
* [Brushless motor]({{ site.url }}/parts#brushless-d2205){:target="_blank"}
* [Brushless ESC]({{ site.url }}/parts#afro-esc-12amp){:target="_blank"}
* [Saw blade]({{ site.url }}/parts#dexter-disc-85mm){:target="_blank"}
* [Turnigy NanoTech 2S LiPo ]({{ site.url }}/parts#nanotech-2s-370mah){:target="_blank"}
* [Turnigy i6 receiver ]({{ site.url }}/parts#turnigy-i6-rx){:target="_blank"}
* 3x 2.5 x 16mm wood screws

## Printing
Download the .stl files [here](https://github.com/Styku/cern-battlebots/tree/master/download/stls/timmy){:target="_blank"} 
or get a [zipped](https://github.com/Styku/cern-battlebots/raw/master/download/stls/timmy/timmy-stl.zip){:target="_blank"} 
version. If you want to modify the design, feel free to fork the 
[OnShape project](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/876aae336eb09ce6dbed248a/w/df23d79c1c15b5b48407cba3/e/a6816d4151a04fb3a5ee5f1b){:target="_blank"}.

### Chassi
All parts can be printed either with PLA, ABS or PETG. Original Timmy was
printed with PETG. __Chassi__ and its cover should be printed with layer height
<= 0.35 mm. For chassi, use supports.

### Wheels
For best traction, you will need to attach some additional rubber using instant
glue. In that case, you can print wheels using any filament available. In case
you do not want to glue any rubber, printing wheels in TPU will help with
traction. In that case, use the alternative design dedicated for TPU printing.

In any case, best print at layer height 0.2 mm.

### Saw blade mounting
No supports, 0.2 mm layer height. TPU would be the best material, but with a
drop of instant glue anything will do just fine.
