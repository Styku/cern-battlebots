# Getting started
{:.no_toc}
If you have no clue how to build a combat bot, you are in the right place.
This short article will guide you through the process of building an
antweight robot.

## Mechanical design
If you are not accustomed with CAD software and want to get a bot as fast
as possible, head to one of our existing [bot guides]({{ site.url }}/bots).
They will contain the 3D designs required for printing the bot chassis,
part listings and other useful information. You will still need to come
back here to learn how to put the electronics together, bind the
receiver and program the transmitter.

If on the other hand you already know a thing or two about mechanical design
and CAD software, then use your suite of choice to make the robot exactly
as you wish it to be. If you are a student, then Autodesk offers a whole lot
of engineering software with educational license for free. I would recommend
[Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/inventor-professional)
in particular. If you are not a student, then [OnShape](http://www.onshape.com)
is your best bet. You can sign-up for a free account and the only restriction is
that you will not be able to make your projects private.
