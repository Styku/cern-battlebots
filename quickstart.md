# Getting started
If you have no clue how to build a combat bot, you are in the right place. 
This short article will guide you through the process of building an 
antweight robot.

## Mechanical design
If you are not accustomed with CAD software and want to get a bot as fast 
as possible, head to one of our exisitng [bot guides]({{ site.url }}/bots}).
They will contain the 3D designs required for printing the bot chassis, 
part listings and other usefull information. You will still need to come 
back here to learn how to put the electronics together, bind the 
receiver and program the transmitter.

If on the other hand you already now a thing or two about mechanical design 
and CAD software, then use your suite of choice to make the robot exactly 
as you wish it to be. If you are a student, then Autodesk offers a whole lot 
of engineering software with educational licence for free. I'd recommend 
[Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/inventor-professional) 
in particular. If you are not a student, then [OnShape](http://www.onshape.com) 
is your best bet. You can sign-up for a free account. The only restriction is 
that you will not be able to make your projects private.
