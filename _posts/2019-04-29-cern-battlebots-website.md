title: CERN Battlebots website
---
The website for our little league is up! In principle, it should serve as a knowledge base, reference and a hub for all of our designs, to facilitate creating new bots and helping newcomers to build their first one.

All this is just a static Jekyll website hosted on Github pages, so anybody willing to help keeping it up to date should make himself known, no technical knowledge required, just basics of HTML and Markdown.
