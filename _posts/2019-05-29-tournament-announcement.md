title: Second antweight tournament announcement
---

After an overwhelming success of the first tournament, which gathered a whole lot of six participants and multiple (more or less four) audience members, we decided to actually announce the second event publicly! Little robots will fight to death in an antweight formula 14th of August in a place somewhere in between Ideasquare and R1. We still need to figure out the details.

If you would like to actively participate in the process of joyful, downsized destruction - let us know using the [Contact form]({{ site.url }}/contact) on this website. In the [Bots]({{ site.url }}/bots) section you can read the build guides for some of the previous participants, along with necessary design files, parts lists etc. That would be a good place to start if you are unsure how to fix a combat robot. 

### Rules

Arena is a box of roughly 100cm x 100cm x 25cm dimensions. The __weight restriction__ is __250g__ and there are __no dimensional restrictions__ as long as your robot fits in the arena.
