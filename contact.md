## Contact
As much as we do not host regular meetings, we do keep in touch and help each
other with designing, testing and validating our robots. Once in a while we will
organize a meeting, go out for a beer or hold a tournament. If you want to be
included, let us know below, we will welcome you with open arms and add you to
our communication channels!
